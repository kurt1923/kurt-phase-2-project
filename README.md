# Bro Splits Pro #

An application built to assist users in planning hypertrophy based exercise splits.

## Description ##

Bro Splits Pro is a web application created for all you exercise enthusiasts out there. Bro Splits is a encyclopedia of my favorite weighttlifting exercises for muscular hypertrophy. The application lets users view the exercises by searching or filtering a specific body part. If the user wants to add exercsises there is a form to do so. If users are not happy with certain exercises they can delete them from their exercise inventory. Users are able to add their favorite exercises by clicking on the favorite buttons on the exercise page. They can then view their favorite exercises on the favorites page. The application also shows split examples so when it is time to hit the weights, the user can refer to the split they choose and plug in their favorite exercises to work out with. If the user is unsure of how to do the exercise, they can click on the video button and will be shown the corresponding video on the videos page. Below are some pictures illustrating the apps use.
